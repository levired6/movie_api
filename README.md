# movie_api
 myFlix API project
 Objective:
 To  build  an "API" (Application Programming Interface)  server-side  component  of  a  “movies”  web  application. 
 The  web application  will  provide  users  with  access  to  information  about  different  
 movies,   directors,   and  genres.  Users  will  be  able  to  sign  up,   update  their  
 personal  information,   and  create  a  list  of  their  favorite  movies.
